Problem Statement
Build a comprehensive financial risk assessment platform that integrates machine learning models with MLflow experiment tracking to create an interactive web application for EMI prediction.
Nowadays, people struggle to pay EMI due to poor financial planning and inadequate risk assessment. This project aims to solve this critical issue by providing data-driven insights for better loan decisions.
The platform should deliver:
Dual ML problem solving: Classification (EMI eligibility) and Regression (maximum EMI amount)
Real-time financial risk assessment using 400,000 records
Advanced feature engineering from 22 financial and demographic variables
ML flow integration for model tracking and comparison
Streamlit Cloud deployment for production-ready access
Complete CRUD operations for financial data management

Business Use Cases
Financial Institutions
Automate loan approval processes and reduce manual underwriting time by 80%
Implement risk-based pricing strategies for different EMI scenarios
Real-time eligibility assessment for walk-in customers

FinTech Companies
Instant EMI eligibility checks for digital lending platforms
Integration with mobile apps for pre-qualification services
Automated risk scoring for loan applications
Banks and Credit Agencies
Data-driven loan amount recommendations based on financial capacity
Portfolio risk management and default prediction
Regulatory compliance through documented decision processes
Loan Officers and Underwriters
AI-powered recommendations for loan approval decisions
Comprehensive financial profile analysis in seconds
Historical performance tracking and model accuracy monitoring
Approach
Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing
Load the provided dataset of 400,000 realistic financial records across 5 EMI scenarios
Implement comprehensive data cleaning for missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates
Apply data quality assessment and validation checks
Create train-test-validation splits for model development
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyze EMI eligibility distribution patterns across different lending scenarios
Study correlation between financial variables and loan approval rates
Investigate demographic patterns and risk factor relationships
Generate comprehensive statistical summaries and business insights
Step 3: Feature Engineering
Create derived financial ratios (debt-to-income, expense-to-income, affordability ratios)
Generate risk scoring features based on credit history and employment stability
Apply categorical encoding and numerical feature scaling
Develop interaction features between key financial variables
Step 4: Machine Learning Model Development
Classification Models (EMI Eligibility Prediction) - Minimum 3 Models Required:
Logistic Regression for baseline interpretable results
Random Forest Classifier for feature importance analysis
XGBoost Classifier for high-performance gradient boosting
Additional models: Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, or Gradient Boosting Classifier
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Best performing classification model will be selected for final deployment
Regression Models (Maximum EMI Amount Prediction) - Minimum 3 Models Required:
Linear Regression for baseline performance
Random Forest Regressor for ensemble-based predictions
XGBoost Regressor for advanced gradient boosting
Additional models: Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, or Gradient Boosting Regressor
Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, R-squared, and MAPE
Best performing regression model will be selected for final deployment
Step 5: Model Selection and MLflow Integration
Train minimum 3 models each for classification and regression problems
Configure MLflow tracking server for organized experiment management
Log comprehensive model parameters, hyperparameters, and performance metrics for all models
Create systematic artifact storage for models, visualizations, and datasets
Compare model performance using MLflow experiment tracking dashboard
Select best performing models based on evaluation metrics for production deployment
Implement model registry for version control and selected model storage

Step 6: Streamlit Application Development
Multi-page web application with intuitive user interface
Real-time prediction capabilities for both classification and regression
Interactive data exploration and visualization components
Model performance monitoring and MLflow integration dashboard
Administrative interface for data management operations
Step 7: Cloud Deployment and Production
Deploy complete application on Streamlit Cloud platform
Implement responsive design for cross-platform accessibility
Configure automated deployment pipeline from GitHub repository
Ensure proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms
